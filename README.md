## What does it do?
It's a web server that lets you check if a website is reachable or not from the location you're running the web server on. So for example if a website is unreachable for you locally, but it's reachable through this web server running at another geographical location, it could mean that the site is blocked for you, or you got network problems.

### Why create this?
Simply as an exercise for learning Go.

### My goal with this project.
My goal was to create a website with Go that didn't use any Javascript at all. I'm mainly a Javascript developer, so this was a pretty unusual exercise, but it was fun!
