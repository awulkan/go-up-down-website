## Is the site up or down?
This repo contains a Go web server that hosts a website where you can enter a URL and find out if it's reachable from the server location the website is running at.

### Why create this?
Simply as an exercise for learning Go.

### My goal with this project.
My goal was to create a website with Go that didn't use any Javascript at all. I'm mainly a Javascript developer, so this was a pretty unusual exercise, but it was fun!
